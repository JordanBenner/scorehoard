# scorehoard

Scorehoard does the hard work of tracking your users' high scores for you. 

Just hook your game into our API, and then when once the players see their scores we'll automatically add them to our database and send you back the list of high scores.

Scorehoard is flexible, and works with any game. You tell us how you want your high scores to be added up, and we do the rest.
