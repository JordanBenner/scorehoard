## Description
ScoreHoard is an API that tracks scores for videogame makers. Our service allows you to send scores (and the usernames associated with the scores) into us so that we can add them to out database. And it allows you to receive your cumulative scoring data back. 

Game makers can use our API to avoid dealing with database management. Let us store your scoring data for you, and you can access it and style it into a leaderboard, hiscores table, etc. whenever you want.
